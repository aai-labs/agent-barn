# Communications plugins and gateway — change log

Status: Active
Epic: Communications plugin architecture
Related context: [Agents](../agents.md), [Activity and Ingest](../activity-and-ingest.md), [Runtime and Deployment](../../architecture/runtime-and-deployment.md), [gateway ownership ADR](../../adr/2026-08-22-agent-barn-owned-communications-gateway.md)

## Current state

- Delivered: Agent-subordinate Communication Connection persistence and scoped CRUD; explicit shipped Platform Plugin registry; Slack, Telegram, Discord, and Microsoft Teams plugins; the first webhook-ingress platform, authenticated by Bot Framework JWT verification at the `verify_webhook` seam; strict plugin-owned settings/credential schemas; encrypted credential envelopes; generic credential uniqueness; optimistic concurrency; platform catalogue; connection-scoped canonical Conversation Messages; durable inbound/outbound Communication Deliveries; gateway-supervised Slack Socket Mode, Telegram polling, and Discord Gateway ingress; database ingress leases; a separately served gateway; one versioned runtime-neutral protocol used by both runtimes; Slack channel/thread mention admission with durable Connection-scoped thread ownership; provider-neutral processing feedback with Slack reactions and assistant thread status; bounded adaptive idle claim backoff shared by both runtime adapters; and an optional, best-effort Platform Plugin seam that resolves missing sender/channel names through cached provider lookups before persistence.
- Changed: Agents are headless and no longer own a single Platform. Legacy provider configuration tables, DTO fields, routes, and provider-specific UI have been removed after their data is migrated into Communication Connections.
- Next: add Agent Barn Chat as another adapter at the Platform Plugin seam, then evaluate iMessage transport constraints independently of Agent runtimes.
- Blockers: none.

## Changes

### 2026-08-26 — AF-118 — Microsoft Teams platform plugin — PR pending

- Delivered: A shipped Microsoft Teams Platform Plugin with schema-driven Azure credentials (App ID, client secret, tenant ID), the same channel/DM policy settings the other platforms expose, and a provider setup hint covering Azure Bot creation, secret retrieval, enabling the Teams channel, and pasting the Connection's webhook URL into the bot's messaging endpoint. Teams is the first plugin to use `WEBHOOK_INGRESS`: inbound activities are authenticated through `verify_webhook` against the Bot Framework JWKS, requiring the documented issuer and the Connection's own App ID as audience. Outbound replies use the Bot Connector API, threading through the reply-to-activity form.
- Changed: Nothing existing. Teams adds `skip_teams_token_validation` alongside the other per-platform validation switches and a new `api/infrastructure/msteams/` client for token acquisition, activity delivery, and inbound token verification.
- Notes: A Teams channel conversation id carries a `;messageid=` suffix on thread replies; the plugin splits it so one channel stays one conversation and the suffix becomes the thread id. Sender identity prefers the Entra `aadObjectId` and falls back to the Teams `29:` user id, because the object id is not present in every context.
- Follow-up: Teams app package (manifest) generation so operators do not hand-author a manifest to sideload the bot; no seam exists for it yet, and `APPLICATION_PROVISIONING` remains unconsumed.

### 2026-08-26 — Agent retirement releases Connection credentials — PR pending

- Delivered: Retiring (soft-deleting) an Agent now retires all owned Communication Connections in the same transaction, cancels pending and processing deliveries, clears credential identity material, and releases platform credentials for reassignment. Historical Conversation Messages remain preserved.
- Changed: Agent-owned Connection cleanup is explicit because a soft delete does not trigger the database foreign-key cascade.

### 2026-08-25 — Provider setup guidance — PR pending

- Changed: Platform descriptors now expose optional provider-owned setup hints in the schema-driven Connection form. Slack, Discord, and Telegram hints now document credential locations/formats, required scopes or Gateway intents, bot membership/visibility requirements, and provider-specific polling or privacy setup.

### 2026-08-25 — AF-272 — Restore communication sender/channel names — PR pending

- Delivered: An optional `enrich_inbound` Platform Plugin seam resolves missing sender and channel/DM display names through cached, credential-scoped provider lookups (Slack user/channel/DM directory, Discord user/channel lookups, Telegram chat lookups) before durable persistence. `CommunicationsGatewayService` invokes it once at the single point all three ingress paths (supervised provider ingress, driver events, webhook events) already share, so no route duplicates the call. A provider payload's own names are always preferred; enrichment only fills what's missing, and any lookup failure falls back to the envelope as normalized rather than delaying or rejecting acceptance.
- Changed: `CommunicationDeliveryRepository.accept_inbound` now backfills `sender_name`/`channel_name` on a duplicate provider delivery via `COALESCE`, so a retry can supply a name the first attempt lacked, but a duplicate can never clear a name already known. `ConversationRepository.upsert_messages` got the same `COALESCE` fix. Runtime outbound replies now inherit `channel_name` from their source inbound envelope's location. The Telegram chat-name cache key is now scoped by a hash of the bot token, matching Discord's existing per-token scoping, so two Connections can no longer share a cached name for the same provider-global chat/user ID. Message identity, delivery ordering/retries, and credential isolation are unchanged.
- Follow-up: none. Hermes/OpenClaw telemetry plugins intentionally remain untouched — they own Tool Call telemetry only; Conversation Message names are resolved solely at the Platform Plugin seam.

### 2026-08-24 — AF-272 — Bounded runtime claim backoff — PR pending

- Delivered: The shared Hermes/OpenClaw Communications adapter now exponentially backs off empty claim responses from 500 ms to a bounded 5-second cadence with jitter, then resets immediately after a delivery is claimed.
- Changed: Idle cadence is client-side; no new server/database polling loop or protocol version was introduced. Claim ordering, leases, retries, idempotency, and shutdown/error handling remain unchanged.
- Follow-up: Communications cutover slices are complete; next platform work can proceed at the Platform Plugin seam.

### 2026-08-24 — AF-272 — Slack processing feedback — PR pending

- Delivered: Accepted Slack messages receive an immediate 👀 reaction; claimed deliveries show a Slack assistant processing status; successful outbound provider delivery replaces 👀 with ✅; terminal runtime/provider failure clears status, removes 👀, and adds ❌.
- Changed: Added the provider-neutral processing-feedback capability and lifecycle seam. Slack's calls use existing `chat:write` and `reactions:write` scopes, target reactions by the canonical message timestamp, treat duplicate reaction state as success, and remain best-effort so feedback cannot alter durable delivery outcomes.
- Follow-up: Replace idle runtime claim polling with bounded long polling/backoff.

### 2026-08-24 — AF-272 — Slack mention and thread admission — PR pending

- Delivered: Slack channel messages now require a direct bot mention. The schema-driven `thread_mention_policy` setting supports conservative `every_message` admission and conversational `start_only` admission for unmentioned replies in Agent-owned threads.
- Changed: Slack ingress captures the bot user ID, rejects bot/edit events, and consumes only normalized `message` events to avoid duplicate `app_mention` deliveries. Thread ownership is resolved through persisted Connection-scoped Conversation Message state via the provider-neutral plugin admission seam.
- Follow-up: Restore provider-neutral processing feedback, then replace idle runtime claim polling with bounded long polling/backoff.

### 2026-08-22 — Hard cutover to communications plugins and gateway — PR pending

- Delivered: generic Agent-owned Communication Connections, multiple same-platform connections, the code-owned plugin catalogue, shipped Slack/Telegram/Discord plugins, credential encryption/fingerprints, safe read projections, complete schema-driven create/edit management, Agent-permission authorization, optimistic concurrency, retirement, connection-scoped conversation reads, durable delivery workers, supervised provider ingress with replica-safe leases, and runtime protocol adapters.
- Removed: the incomplete Microsoft Teams plugin and its legacy multi-tenant authentication path. A future Teams plugin must be designed around Microsoft's supported single-tenant identity model before it is shipped.
- Changed: migrated existing provider configuration and attributable messages, removed the single-platform Agent schema and native runtime transport branching, and replaced provider-specific Agent forms with schema-driven Connection management.
