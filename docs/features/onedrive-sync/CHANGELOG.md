# OneDrive sync — change log

Status: Active
Epic: AF-383 — Connect an Organization to OneDrive
Related context: [Integrations](../integrations.md), [RBAC implementation brief](../rbac/IMPLEMENTATION-BRIEF.md), [epic guideline](../../guidelines/epics.md)

## Current state

- Delivered: the platform app settings `ONEDRIVE_SYNC_CLIENT_ID` and `ONEDRIVE_SYNC_CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/core/config.py`. `Config.is_onedrive_sync_enabled` is true only when both are non-blank. Nothing reads the settings yet.
- Delivered: verification of the Microsoft flow (T-1, T-5) against a real tenant, recorded in the 2026-10-14 entry.
- In transition: nothing.
- Next: deploy wiring (Helm, Helmfile, deploy workflows, operations guide).
- Blockers: none.

Acceptance criteria amendment: another Organization's caller gets **403**, not 404. `get_current_user()` refuses a caller outside the path Organization before any route runs, as for every Organization-scoped resource; 404 concealment applies to Agent resources only ([RBAC implementation brief](../rbac/IMPLEMENTATION-BRIEF.md)).

## Changes

### 2026-10-14 — AF-383 — Platform app settings

- Delivered: `onedrive_sync_client_id`, `onedrive_sync_client_secret` and `is_onedrive_sync_enabled` on `Config`, with unit coverage in `api/tests/unit/test_config_onedrive_sync.py`.
- Changed: optional OneDrive sync blocks in `.env.spec` and `.env.deploy.spec`, naming the redirect URI `<WEB_APP_URL>/api/v1/integrations/onedrive-sync/callback` and the required Microsoft Graph permissions.
- Follow-up: deploy wiring.

### 2026-10-14 — AF-383 — Microsoft flow verification (no code)

- Verified by hand (browser and PowerShell) against a test SharePoint site, using a multi-tenant app with application `Sites.Selected` and delegated `Sites.FullControl.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, `openid`, `profile`:
  - Admin consent at `/organizations/v2.0/adminconsent` with `.default` succeeded once a Microsoft Global Administrator approved it. A non-admin gets Microsoft's "Need admin approval" page.
  - T-5: signing in at `/organizations/oauth2/v2.0/authorize` after consent showed only the account picker, with no second consent prompt.
  - A confidential-client code redemption returned tokens; the tenant came from the `id_token` `tid`.
  - The delegated token resolved the site and created a `write` site permission for the app.
  - T-1: an app-only token in that tenant created the "Agent Barn" folder in the site's default library and uploaded a file into it. The folder `webUrl` has the form `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site>/Shared%20Documents/Agent%20Barn`.
- Follow-up: the connect UI must say that approving the app needs a Microsoft Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator.
